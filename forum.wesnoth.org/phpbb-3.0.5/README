In this directory are located several custom (e.g. for
Wesnoth only) patches applied over the vanilla phpBB
distribution for the wesnoth.org forums.

Some patches may require additional fiddling with the phpBB
config or database tables. Please read every patch's
accompanying README file for additional installation steps.
If a patch doesn't have a corresponding README file, you
can assume it doesn't require any further fiddling to get
properly installed.

In general, to apply a patch, use:

  patch -p1 < patchfile.diff

... on the phpBB root directory (e.g. /public/forum).
