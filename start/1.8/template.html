<h2 id='game'>What's New in Wesnoth 1.8</h2>

<p>The improvements this time around include one entire new
full-length campain, hundreds of new and revised unit portraits, four
new music tracks, some UI redesign, and substantial improvements in the
game's AI.</p>

<h3 id='players'>For Players</h3>

<h4 id='campaigns'>Campaigns</h4>

<p>A new campaign, <cite>Delfador's Memoirs</cite>, tells the tale of
how a mage-apprentice rose to become Delfador the Great. This campaign
was imported from the <a
href="http://wesnoth-umc-dev.sourceforge.net">Wesnoth-UMC-Dev
project</a>, where it spent almost a year being adapted for
mainline.</p>

<p>We've continued to polish and improve the mainline campaigns.  The
hero Kaleh's custom advancements in <cite>Under the Burning
Suns</cite>, long a source of problems, have been debugged and
streamlined. Significant continuity problems in <cite>Heir to the
Throne's</cite> "Cliffs of Thoria" scenario have been fixed. Some
later scenarios in <cite>Legend of Wesmere</cite> have been rewritten
and significantly enhanced.</p>

<div class='thumb tright'>
  <div><a href='images/start-2-full.jpg'><img src='images/start-2.jpg' alt='Wesnoth Screenshot'/></a></div>
</div>

<p>There are four new full-orchestral music tracks: <cite>Casualties
of War</cite>, <cite>Into the Shadows</cite>, <cite>Over the Northern
Mountains</cite>, and <cite>Journey's End</cite>.</p>

<p>The game AI has been significantly debugged and improved; it
chooses recruits/recalls better, and does smarter target selection.</p>

<h4 id='multiplayer'>Multiplayer</h4>

<p>The multiplayer lobby has been completely redesigned for improved
ease of play and better appearance.</p>

<p>Random numbers are generated on the Wesnoth server during MP
combats. This make certain kinds of cheats and out-of-sync conditions
impossible, at the cost of breaking compatibility with versions before
1.7.3.</p>

  <div><a href='images/start-1-full.jpg'><img src='images/start-1.jpg' alt='Wesnoth Screenshot'/></a></div>
</div>

<p>There have been no unit multiplayer unit balancing changes in this
release.</p>

<h4 id='general'>General</h4>

<p>The right sidebar on the main game display has been tuned for
usability. It now gives more prominance to the selected unit's
terrain defence percentage and time-of-day modifier.</p>

<p>There is a new monster unit: the Water Serpent.  Additionally, the
Dwarvish Scout from Under the Burning Suns is now part of normal
Dwarvish sides in campaigns. Several other unit lines - most notably
the Drakes &mdash; have been completely redone with improved art and
animations.</p>

<p>Add-on descriptions are now visible on the download server.</p>

<p>Most translations have been updated.  New translations include English
in the Shavian alphabet and Vietnamese.</p>

<h3 id='campdev'>For Content Developers</h3>

<p>This year Wesnoth was once again a Google "Summer of Code" program;
one of its major results was a complete rework of the Wesnoth map
editor and its interface, making it a friendlier tool for content
developers.</p>

<p>Our "Summer of Art" program, working in concert with Google's "Summer
of Code", produced big results.  There are hundreds of new and
reworked unit portraits available for your add-ons. There are new
terrain graphics as well, including the Orcish Village and Orcish
Keep.</p>

  <div><a href='images/start-3-full.jpg'><img src='images/start-3.jpg' alt='Wesnoth Screenshot'/></a></div>
</div>

<p>We paid a lot of attention to world continuity, from small details
like replacing earth-human names for characters up through larger ones
like putting many new placenames on the main map. The main Wesnoth
history timeline has been tweaked to eliminate various minor
inconsistencies.</p>

<p>More of the AI's control parameters can now be modified
from with WML, enabling campaign designers to give enemy sides more
distinct tactical personalities.</p>

<p>We kept the promise we made in 1.6 when we had to remove Python for
technical reasons; WML events can now be written in lua.</p>

<p>It is now possible for translators to localize images in
Wesnoth. For more information and tutorials, look at the wiki article
on <a href="http://wiki.wesnoth.org/ImageLocalization">Image
Localization</a>.</p>
