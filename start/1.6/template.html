<h2 id='game'>What's New in Wesnoth 1.6</h2>

<!--
TODO: so far this is *ONLY* a paste of the rough text ESR wrote. It should
be split up into parts and assigned to the different areas. Beside this some
more content could/should be added about balancing and all the stuff. And some
images showing the lovely new stuff have to be created, too...
As a possible reference how it *CAN* look, have a look at the 1.4 announcement
template:

-->

<p>We have many new features for your delectation this time around:</p>

<p>First, the new game content: There is a new mainline campaign, <em>The
Legend of Wesmere</em>, with new gameplay features including (in one
scenario) the ability to use the game AI as your commander for an
allied side, setting its objectives as you like.  Multiplayer has two
new maps, 4p <em>Underworld</em> and 4p <em>A New Land</em>; existing maps have been
revised and updated. There are two new units (Dread Bat and Royal
Warrior), and one new terrain (cave path).</p>
 
<p>Many mainline campaigns have improved storyline prose and new
cutscenes or epilogs.  Several have improved and redrawn campaign
maps. All now have dates in the Wesnoth history timeline and almost
all have journey animations on their campaign maps.  The history and
geography of Wesnoth have been developed in more depth and detail, and
more campaigns now include references to events in that overall
history, adding depth and richness to the narration.</p>
 
<p>The game graphics have been improved, with a whole new range of unit
portraits in more realistic styles.  Many more units have full
animations and team coloring. Forests get more variety with graphics
for spring/summer, fall, and winter deciduous forest terrains.  There
are new village graphics for human cities and primitive tribal
areas. There are three new original background tracks: <em>Heroes' Rite</em>,
<em>The Dangerous Symphony</em>, and <em>The Deep Path</em>, and three special music
clips for victory and defeat events.</p>
 
<p>The game interface has continued to evolve, especially in making more
dramatic use of portaits.  Unit recall dialogs now display useful
information about your veterans' traits.  Addons now display their
category when you browse them on the download server.</p>
 
<p>For content authors, the map editor is much improved.  It can be
started from within the game now.  You can toggle overlay displays
of terrain codes and map coordinates while editing. The editor can
handle multiple maps in a session, and you can take screenshots of
full maps.  There's also a new interactive editing tool for animated
journey tracks.</p>
 
<p>Less visible changes include improvements in the game AI, including a new
formula-based AI that allows more flexible setting of objectives and an
improved pathfinding algorithm.  As usual, WML has grown more powerful
with many new tags and attributes to extend the range of what 
campaign authors can do.</p>
 
<p>A few features have been removed.  The gamma-correction slider is
gone; crash bugs in the SDL implementation behind the feature made it
too dangerous.  The support for writing Python AIs has been removed
because the feature opened a serious security hole; we hope to build a
functionally similar feature, possibly using a different and safer
extension language, in 1.7.</p>
 
<p>New game translations include Arabic, Croatian, Friulian, Latvian,
Macedonian, and Marathi.  Existing translations have been extensively
updated and revised.</p>
