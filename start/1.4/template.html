<h3 id='game'>What's New in Wesnoth 1.4</h3>

<p>The 1.4 version brings you no fewer than seven new mainline campaigns, a
redesigned user interface, an amazing variety of high-quality new game
music, and a refresh of the game artwork including improved portrait
images for many unit types.</p>

<p>Just as importantly, it is probably our most solid release yet.  We
retired over 300 individual bugs during the 1.3 development period,
and introduced several new tools that prevent entire classes of bugs
by sanity-checking Wesnoth's data files before they ship to you.</p>

</div>

<p>Here are some of 1.4's new features:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Six well-known user-contributed campaigns now ship with the game</b></dt>
<dd><p>We have more than doubled the number of campaigns we ship.
Polished, upgraded and improved versions of the following well-known 
user-written campaigns now ship with the game: <i>Descent into Darkness, 
Liberty, Northern Rebirth, Sceptre of Fire, An Orcish Incursion, and
Son of the Black-Eye.</i></p></dd>

<dt><b>One brand new, all original campaign by an open-source luminary</b>
</dt> 
<dd><p>Eric S. Raymond, the open-source &uuml;bergeek who wrote <a
href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral
and the Bazaar</a>, has a not-so-well-kept secret; he loves strategy
games. ESR joined our development team nine months ago, and in between
contributing code and bugfixes he found time to write an all-new
campaign for 1.4: <em>The Hammer of Thursagan</em>.</p></dd>

<dt><b>The user interface of the game has been redesigned</b>
</dt> 
<dd><p>The 1.4 Wesnoth user interface has a cleaner look and feel,
with lightweight semi-transparent transient windows replacing many of
the old-fashioned opaque modal dialogues with buttons.  Subtle new
graphics effects when you select a unit and target an enemy help you
keep track of what is going on without getting between you and the
gameplay. The game now displays owned and total villages in the
status bar. Interface actions and day/night changes now have
unobtrusive cue sounds.  You can use drag'n'drop to move units.
Mousewheels are supported.</p></dd>

<dt><b>You can now review scenarios, chat, and set options after victory</b>
</dt> 
<dd><p>You'll no longer get two modal dialogues full of checkbox
options immediately after victory in a scenario and then be instantly
returned to the lobby (or, in campaigns, jumped to the next scenario).
Instead, there's just one summary popup, after which you'll be in a
'linger mode' that allows you to chat with friends and foes, use
normal commands, change your options, and in general do anything
except more battle actions.</p></dd>

<dt><b>The multiplayer collection has been revised and extended</b>
</dt> 
<dd><p>New maps and multiplayer campaigns: <cite>
Auction-X, 
Dark Forecast
Hamlets, 
Mokena Prairie, 
The Manzivan Traps, 
Xanthe Chaos,
</cite>.  Revised maps:
<cite>Alirok Marsh</cite> (formerly <cite>Triple Blitz</cite>),<cite>
Amohsad Caldera, 
Blue Water Province, 
Castle Hopping Isle, 
Caves of the Basilisk</cite> (formerly <cite>Blitz</cite>), <cite>
Crossing, 
Crusaders Fields, 
Cynsaun Battlefield, 
Den of Onis, 
Fallenstar Lake</cite> (formerly <cite>Meteor Lake</cite>), <cite>
Forest of Fear, 
Freelands</cite> (formerly <cite>Charge</cite>),<cite> 
Hexcake,

Merkwuerdigliebe, 
Morituri, 
Paths of Daggers, 
Sablestone Delta,

<dt><b>Changed units</b>
</dt> 
<dd><p>The Footpad and Thug units can advance all the way to level
3.  Many units have been tuned and rebalanced, including 
Ancient Lich, 
Elvish Sorceress,
Fugitive, 
Ghost, 
Hurricane Drake, 
Lich, 
Mage of Light, 
Mermaid Diviner, 
Mermaid Priestess, 
Merman Warrior,
Naga Myrmidon,
Necromancer, 
Orcish Assassin, 
Ranger,
Royal Guard, 
Sky Drake,
White Mage, 
Wraith, 
and all the Saurians and Bats.</p></dd>

<dt><b>The map editor is much more capable.</b>
</dt> 
<dd><p>Maps can now be opened directly from a scenario file and saved
back to it.  Starting positions no longer need to be on keeps.  The
terrain palette is divided into groups of like terrains, so you'll
scroll it less often.  And there are many new terrains; farmland,
Elvish castle, and windmill have been added to the basic set, and
there are bridges for crossing swamp, deep water, or chasms. </p></dd>

<dt><b>New uses of animation</b>
</dt> 
<dd><p>Many more units have full combat animation.  Some units and
items now have standing animations; bats flap their wings and
campfires flicker.  Units can now have special death animations --
some Drakes burst into flame when killed.</p></dd>

<dt><b>New weapons and weapon types</b>
</dt> 
<dd><p>Undead axe, undead crossbow, pickaxe, glaive, elven staff, 
chainmace.</p></dd>

<dt><b>New sound effects and music</b>
</dt> 
<dd><p>Effects for morning star, arcane magic, hatchet, slowdown. Five
new symphonic music tracks.</dd>

<dt><b></b>
