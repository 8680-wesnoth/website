<h2 id='game'>What’s New in Wesnoth 1.10</h2>

<!--TODO: Screenshot from inside of Dead Water that better shows off the new water *and* new grass.-->

</div>

<p>The list of improvements this time includes beautiful new terrain art, a brand new campaign, a lot of work on the UI, and many improvements to WML.</p>

<h3 id='players'>For Players</h3>

<p>To help you quickly identify slowed units, they are now tinted light blue. Several more improvements took place in the side bar to make it more appealing and values easier to grasp.</p>

<p>Thanks to Google Summer of Code projects from 2010 and 2011 there is a new <cite>Whiteboard</cite> system to help you make plans. It allows you to plan many recruitment and movement actions ahead, and then execute them. The most important aspect of this is that it allows you easier planning and coordinating with your allies in multiplayer matches.</p>




<h4 id='campaigns'>Campaigns</h4>

<!--TODO: better Dead Water summary. I don't like single player -->
<p>The campaign <cite>Dead Water</cite> is now in mainline. In it you play a young merman who is the heir to his kingdom’s throne and your task is to repel an undead invasion. <cite>Dead Water</cite> spent some time being polished in the <a href="http://wesnoth-umc-dev.sourceforge.net">Wesnoth-UMC-Dev project</a> to prepare for its mainline inclusion, just like <cite>Delfador’s Memoirs</cite> from Wesnoth 1.8.</p>

<p>Most of the existing campaigns received minor as well as major updates. For example the storyline in <cite>A Tale of Two Brothers</cite> was significantly improved. In <cite>Legend of Wesmere</cite> several scenarios were reworked including objective changes as well as improvements of the game mechanics.</p>
<!--TODO: What other changes have been made to single player campaigns?-->




<h4 id='multiplayer'>Multiplayer</h4>

</div>

<!--<p>The new lobby from 1.8 has received a lot more polish. It is now stable and ready to use.</p>--> <!--we still use the old lobby as default...-->

<p>There are several new multiplayer maps: <cite>Aethermaw</cite>, <cite>Arcanclave Citadel</cite>, <cite>Thousand Stings Garrison</cite>, and <cite>Volcano</cite>. Numerous updates and balance tweaks were made to other maps. Besides this they also have all been redone to incorporate the new terrain variations.</p>




<h4 id='general'>General</h4>

<p>The first batch of standing animations have arrived. Together with the new animated water, they breath life into the previously near-motionless battlefield. Beside this many portraits were added or updated and plenty new terrains found their way into the game.</p>

<p>Using the improved add-on interface you are now able to uninstall multiple add-ons at once using checkboxes.</p>




<h3 id='campdev'>For Content Developers</h3>

<p>Thanks to the new <a href="http://wiki.wesnoth.org/PersistenceWML">persistent variables</a> feature, add-on authors are now able to save data to the players’ computers. This data will be accessible in future matches or campaign play-throughs.</p>

<p>A batch of new item icons have been included for add-on authors to take advantage of. They include pictures of potions, robes, various types of armor, and some magical looking jewelry. They have been drawn in the style of our existing attack icons.</p>

<p>One of the Google Summer of Code projects from 2010 and 2011 was the creation of a <a href="http://eclipse.wesnoth.org">Wesnoth plugin for Eclipse</a>. It can function as a stand alone program and serves as a full IDE for WML. It includes syntax highlighting, tag folding, auto-completion, and a lot more. It has front-ends for all the WML tools (wmllint, wmlindent, and so on). The plugin also allows you to start the game or map editor right into individual scenarios or maps.</p>
