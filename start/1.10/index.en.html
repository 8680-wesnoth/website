<h2 id='game'>What’s New in Wesnoth 1.10</h2>

<!--TODO: Screenshots that show off more of the new terrains...-->

</div>

<h3 id='players'>For Players</h3>

<p>To help you quickly identify slowed units, they are now tinted light blue. Various improvements were made to the sidebar to make it more appealing and to
make its elements easier to grasp.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Google Summer of Code projects
from 2010 and 2011, there is a new <cite>Whiteboard</cite> system, which can help you make plans by allowing you to visualize recruitment, movements, attacks, and so forth. It can even let you visualize shared plans with your
allies in multiplayer games.</p>




<h4 id='general'>General</h4>

<p>Various units, such as the saurians, have gotten new standing animations. These along with the new animated water help breathe life into the previously
near-motionless battlefield.</p>

</div>

<p>Many portraits were added and updated, thus getting us closer to meeting our goals for completeness and having high-quality art throughout the game.</p>

<p>Lots of new terrains have also been added, thus allowing the possibility of far more interesting maps for players to enjoy.</p>

<p>The lighting system can now illuminate specific areas differently to better show local time of the day effects and, for 
example, keep caves dark during the day.</p>

<p>Substantial improvements have been made in regards to UI design, typography, and consistency.</p>

<p>Various UI improvements have also been made. For example, you can now have Wesnoth use the twelve-hour clock format thanks to a new advanced preference. Another fine example is now being able to remove multiple add-ons at once using
checkboxes.</p>

<p>The 1.10 series features a completely redone version of the old <em>Northerners</em> track as well as a new track: <em>Battle Epic</em>.</p>

<p>Also, two new translations were started: Irish and Old English.</p>




<h4 id='campaigns'>Campaigns</h4>

<p>The campaign <em>Dead Water</em> is now in mainline. In it, you play a young merman who is the heir to his kingdom’s throne; your task is to repel an undead invasion. <em>Dead Water</em> spent some time being polished in the <a href="http://wesnoth-umc-dev.sourceforge.net">Wesnoth-UMC-Dev project</a> to prepare for mainline inclusion, just like
<em>Delfador’s Memoirs</em> from the 1.8 series.</p>

<p>Most of the existing campaigns have received both minor and major updates and improvements. For example, <em>A Tale of Two Brothers</em>’ storyline was significantly improved, and several of <em>Legend of Wesmere</em>’s scenarios
were reworked to include more dynamic gameplay and improved mechanics.</p>




<h4 id='multiplayer'>Multiplayer</h4>

<p>Several new multiplayer maps have been introduced: Aethermaw, Arcanclave Citadel, Thousand Stings Garrison, and Volcano. Numerous updates and balancing tweaks were made to other maps &mdash; including making use of the new terrains.</p>




<h3 id='campdev'>For Content Developers</h3>

<div class='thumb tright'>
  <div><a href='images/start-4-full.jpg'><img src='images/start-4.jpg' alt='Wesnoth Screenshot'/></a></div>
</div>

<p>The 1.10 series brings a lot of new features for content developers, such as the new <a href="http://wiki.wesnoth.org/PersistenceWML">persistent variables</a> feature, which allows add-on authors to save data to
players’ hard disks for use by other content or in future playthroughs.</p>

<p>The game’s Lua capabilities have been strengthened considerably, thus allowing content developers to do much more then they could with it on the 1.8 series. In fact, one of our Google Summer of Code projects was focused on improving
the AI-related Lua capabilities.</p>

<p>Thanks to revisions in the code that handles <a href="http://wiki.wesnoth.org/LanguageWML">[language]</a>, custom range and attack type strings can now be translated.</p>

<p>The terrain palette has been vastly expanded with the addition of new basic terrains as well as new structures and embellishments, thus allowing map makers to create more vibrant maps.</p>


<p>Thanks to a Google Summer of Code project that took place during 2010 and 2011, we now have a <a href="http://eclipse.wesnoth.org">Wesnoth Eclipse plugin</a>, which provides a fullblown IDE for WML in Eclipse thus providing features such as syntax highlighting, tag folding, autocompletion, and more. It even has frontends for maintenance tools such as wmllint and wmlindent as well as the ability to start the game or map editor and
have it go right to the desired scenario or map.</p>

<p>A new batch of item icons&mdash;drawn in the same style as the attack icons&mdash;have been included for the benefit of content creators; depictions of items such as potions, robes, armor, and jewelry are included.</p>
