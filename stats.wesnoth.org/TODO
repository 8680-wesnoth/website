-change hacked up query syntax into one with variable substitution and character escaping
	mysqldb variable substitution only works correctly for column values - may NOT be used on statements, table names
-make the prototype scale to the huge db
	include a cron.daily entry that can be used to regenerate the subsamples
	add more evaluator functions - these test whether a query returned enough results
-add new views
-code clean up
	-make object oriented
	-add a debug mode and a production mode
